# xPollinator (xP)

xPollinator (xP) is a modular landscape modelling component to simulate pollinator forage (nectar & pollen) and related pesticide exposure in space and time. It is built on the xLandscape framework and is intended for research and applied use in environmental risk assessment, landscape design, monitoring and related topics.

## Quick start

1. Clone this repository (HTTPS):

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/xlandscape/xPollinator.git
cd xPollinator
```

2. Explore the documentation in `docs/` — start at `docs/index.md` for an overview and the "Get started" guide at `docs/getstarted/getstarted.md` for installation and demo usage.

3. Try the demo scenario(s):
   - This project uses the companion demo repository `xPollinatorDemo` which contains runnable demo scenarios and templates described in the docs. Clone that repo if you want ready-to-run examples:

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/xlandscape/xPollinatorDemo.git
```

4. Use the demo templates (drag & drop `template.xrun` onto `__start__.bat`, or follow the example instructions in the `xPollinatorDemo` repo) to run a sample model and inspect outputs.

## Documentation

Main documentation lives under `docs/`. Good starting pages:
- `docs/index.md` — project overview and concepts
- `docs/getstarted/getstarted.md` — installation and how to obtain the code
- `docs/reference/` — glossary and reference information

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you plan to contribute:
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch
- Make small, testable commits with clear messages
- Open a pull request and add a short description of the changes

If you need help or want to discuss larger changes, open an issue first so we can coordinate.

## Contact

For questions about the project, see the documentation or contact the maintainers noted in the docs (eg the authors listed in `docs/index.md`).

Small, clear README to help users (and GitHub visitors) quickly understand and access docs/demo. If you'd like, I can add badges (CI, license) and a short license section next.
