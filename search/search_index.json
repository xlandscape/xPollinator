Based on present knowledge and together with data, models have become a key instrument in decision making. An important field is the risk assessment and management of pesticides. In Europe (and countries beyond), this includes an assessment of pollinator risk, in particular, for the honey bee (EFSA Bee Guidance). The risk assessment includes the use of models (eg,  BEEHAVE model, ApisRAM) which require landscape scenarios for their operation. Key information of such scenarios is the occurrence of pollinator forage (mainly nectar and pollen). Beyond the use of xP in a risk assessment and management context and given its modular and flexible design, xP can be employed in a range of related research and applied topics, eg,  </p> <ul> <li>landscape design and management, biodiversity enhancements</li> <li>Holistic view to risk, multiple stressors analysis, systems-based approach, EFSA, Bee Guidance)  </li> <li>Risk Assessment Recovery Option (EFSA, Aquatic Guidance) </li> <li>Environmental Impact Reduction (EIR), eg, what if analysis, assessment and documentation of real-world EIR by new plantprotection products and digital environmental safety solutions  </li> <li>Insect decline analysis: habitat conditions    </li> <li>Monitoring (design, insights, transfer of results to other regions and times)  </li> <li>Solutions for Integrated Pest Management: improved integration of the use of chemicals and agricultural practices to reduce environmental impact, comparison of pest control options (eg, weed control)  </li> <li>Specific Protection Goals: identification of driving factors of populations dynamics for targeted chemical risk assessment endpoints and schemes  </li> <li>Ecosystem Services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment): improvend quantitative insights into real-world Ecosystem Services for more explicit and transparent cost/benefit risk management.

Its conceptual basis is generic and open to be used for any pollinator species, whereas initial bee forage parameterisations and scenarios focus on the honey bee. xP is based on the modular landscape modelling framework xLandscape.</p> <p>Forage supply in the landscape largely determines honey bee activity and so the development of honey bee hives as well as of wild bee colonies. Correspondingly, the spatial and temporal occurrences of forage are essential information to model bee colony development (eg, using BEEHAVE model or ApisRAM). Thus, dynamic forage representation builds the basis for modelling exposure and effects of honey bees due to contact to pesticides. Bee forage is typically composed of nectar and pollen. In addition, honeydew provided by insects (typically living on trees and shrubs, i.e. in woodlands) can also provide an important forage ressource (initially not considered, yet such a module can added any time). In cultivated landscapes, nectar and pollen are provided by a variety of crops, natural and semi-natural vegetation, with a correspondingly spatial and temporal variability of intensities and quality attributes (eg, sugar type, content, protein content). The entire process of modelling beeforage is of modular design. This allows, e.g., to use a range of land use/cover data together with forage provision information as input, depending on the specific xP model purpose.  </p>"},{"location":"index.html#concepts-and-design","title":"Concepts and Design","text":""},{"location":"index.html#framework-and-modularity","title":"Framework and Modularity","text":"<p>xPollinator is a ready-to-use landscape model for spatiotemporally explicit modelling of pollinator risk in real-world landscapes.

Its individual functionalities are represented in modules (called components) which are integrated into the xLandscape framework (figure below). Both, the framework and the modularity make xP flexible to adapt its present capabilities for a range of purposes of modelling pollinator forage (Background), pollinator exposure and effects, different species and for basically any geographic region and extent. Eg, in case a bee forage modeller has data and models to simulate the occurrence of honeydew producers, this can be integrated in the xP landscape model as a new component.  </p> <p> </p> <p>xPollinator landscape model. xP is a modular composition of components using the xLandscape framework.

The explicit steps define xP components (initial focus on vegetation as forage providing landscape element).</p> <p>In the initital implementation of xP, key components for modelling bee forage are:</p> <ul> <li>Land use/land cover (LULC) information: an assembly of spatial data that represents essential LULC types that provide bee forage.

In its inital realisation, the assignments are realised in tabular format and are based on literature and expert knowledge. This early approach is regarded robust and sufficiently accurate for the initial applications of the xP landscape model. However, this simple realisation can be replaced and improved, e.g., by introducing AI on plant communities and phenology models.  </li> <li>BeeForage(x,t): the module to generate actual bee forage occurrence in space and time, i.e., (initially) the provision of nectar and pollen (space, time -&gt; BeeForage(x,t)).</li> <li>BeeHave Scenario Parser: a module for the ready-to-use preparation of bee forage scenario as input for a pollinator model (eg, the BEEHAVE model).</li> </ul> <p>A layered view might support the understanding of data and information layers used in bee forage modelling.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Data and information layers in bee forage modelling.

It integrates within-hive processes (brood care and colony population dynamics) with foraging behaviour and can represent multiple stressors \u2014 such as varroa, weather, forage shortages or pesticide impacts \u2014 to study their combined effects on colony health. BEEHAVE is implemented in NetLogo, comes with a user manual and detailed model description, and is available for download at the BeeHave project site. BEEHAVEecotox is an ecotoxicological extension of BEEHAVE that integrates a mechanistic effect module linking pesticide exposure to colony processes (mortality of foragers, brood, and in-hive bees) and landscape-scale inputs. Implemented in NetLogo, the package includes the NetLogo model code, a landscape extension, example input files (for food sources and pesticide applications), a user manual and technical notes.

PPM Calendars are XML files representing Plant Protection Measures and are composed of one or more Indications (measures to protect crops from certain pests). In xCP, an Indication is an explicit part of its parameterization. You can think of <code>Indication</code> elements, technically, as collections of <code>ApplicationSequence</code> elements. If more than one Application Sequence is defined in an Indication, these sequences are considered alternative Application sequences (\"OR\" related). The xCP parameterization entity Indication can be used to define alternative PPP use pattern, e.g., reflecting product market shares or fractions of biological or organic pest control means. Multiple Indications can be defined in an xCP parameterization, as many as necessary to represent a simple or complex real-world PPP use pattern in one or many crops. In this tutorial, we will be creating a very simple PPP use pattern.</p> Structure of a PPM Calendar <p>The most important things to know are that PPM Calendars apply to one land use type (called the target crop type) and you should create unique PPM Calendars for each use scenario. The target crop type of a calendar is a numeric value corresponding to a numeric land use type in the landscape scenario (<code>feature_type_attribute</code>). </p> <ol> <li>Navigate to the CropProtection folder from the root of the repository. Open the folder PPMCalendars where you will see multiple other folders, each containing one or more PPM Calendars. Create a folder for your PPM Calendars named Tutorial-calendars. Open that folder.</li> <li>Open the Notepad application to start writing your XML file. If you have an application with auto-complete or other text functions like Visual Studio Code, you can also use those to write XML files. Each PPM Calendar starts by defining the root element, <code>PPMCalendar</code>. Add the following lines to your file     <pre><code>&lt;PPMCalendar xmlns=\"urn:xCropProtectionLandscapeScenarioParametrization\"&gt;\n\n&lt;/PPMCalendar&gt;\n</code></pre>     Everything we write in PPM Calendars should fall between the opening and closing tags that we just added. Next we need to determine the <code>TemporalValidity</code>, <code>TargetCropType</code>, and <code>TargetField</code> values. Let's say that this calendar should be applied every year that the simulation runs, so we will add the following line between the opening and closing PPMCalendar tags. Indentation is not necessary but makes XML files easier to read.     <pre><code>&lt;PPMCalendar xmlns=\"urn:xCropProtectionLandscapeScenarioParametrization\"&gt;\n    &lt;TemporalValidity scales=\"time/simulation\"&gt; always &lt;/TemporalValidity&gt;\n&lt;/PPMCalendar&gt;\n</code></pre>     The next two options restrict either the crop type or the field/feature ID that this calendar can be applied to. You can specify one or both, but in this case we will only define <code>TargetCropType</code>. Any PPP applications defined in this calendar will only apply to fields/features with the LULC type 222.     <pre><code>&lt;PPMCalendar xmlns=\"urn:xCropProtectionLandscapeScenarioParametrization\"&gt;\n    &lt;TemporalValidity scales=\"time/simulation\"&gt; always &lt;/TemporalValidity&gt;\n    &lt;TargetCrops type=\"list[int]\" scales=\"global\"&gt; 222 &lt;/TargetCrops&gt;\n&lt;/PPMCalendar&gt;\n</code></pre></li> <li>Define <code>Indication</code> elements and <code>ApplicationSequence</code> elements. An <code>Indications</code> element always needs to enclose <code>Indication</code> elements; it can be thought of as a collection of multiple <code>Indication</code> elements.     <pre><code>&lt;PPMCalendar xmlns=\"urn:xCropProtectionLandscapeScenarioParametrization\"&gt;\n    &lt;TemporalValidity scales=\"time/simulation\"&gt; always &lt;/TemporalValidity&gt;\n    &lt;TargetCrops type=\"list[int]\" scales=\"global\"&gt; 222 &lt;/TargetCrops&gt;\n    &lt;Indications&gt;\n        &lt;Indication type=\"xCropProtection.ChoiceDistribution\" scales=\"time/year, space/base_geometry\"&gt;\n        &lt;/Indication&gt;\n    &lt;/Indications&gt;\n&lt;/PPMCalendar&gt;\n</code></pre>     You will notice that the <code>Indication</code> element has a type of \"xCropProtection.ChoiceDistribution\". This means that only one of its child elements will be chosen to be applied (sampled for each field and year). It also means that probability values need to be defined for each child element. In this tutorial, this <code>Indication</code> represents the possible response to Mullein bugs in apples and we will provide two product options.     <pre><code>&lt;PPMCalendar xmlns=\"urn:xCropProtectionLandscapeScenarioParametrization\"&gt;\n    &lt;TemporalValidity scales=\"time/simulation\"&gt; always &lt;/TemporalValidity&gt;\n    &lt;TargetCrops type=\"list[int]\" scales=\"global\"&gt; 222 &lt;/TargetCrops&gt;\n    &lt;Indications&gt;\n        &lt;Indication type=\"xCropProtection.ChoiceDistribution\" scales=\"time/year, space/base_geometry\"&gt;\n            &lt;ApplicationSequence probability=\"0.65\"&gt;\n            &lt;/ApplicationSequence&gt;\n            &lt;ApplicationSequence probability=\"0.35\"&gt;\n            &lt;/ApplicationSequence&gt;\n        &lt;/Indication&gt;\n    &lt;/Indications&gt;\n&lt;/PPMCalendar&gt;\n</code></pre></li> <li>Now that the <code>ApplicationSequence</code> elements have been defined, we can add <code>Application</code> elements for each sequence. An <code>ApplicationSequence</code> can have one or more <code>Application</code> elements, and if an <code>ApplicationSequence</code> is sampled, each <code>Application</code> in the sequence will be applied to the field.     <pre><code>&lt;PPMCalendar xmlns=\"urn:xCropProtectionLandscapeScenarioParametrization\"&gt;\n    &lt;TemporalValidity scales=\"time/simulation\"&gt; always &lt;/TemporalValidity&gt;\n    &lt;TargetCrops type=\"list[int]\" scales=\"global\"&gt; 222 &lt;/TargetCrops&gt;\n    &lt;Indications&gt;\n        &lt;Indication type=\"xCropProtection.ChoiceDistribution\" scales=\"time/year, space/base_geometry\"&gt;\n            &lt;ApplicationSequence probability=\"0.65\"&gt;\n                &lt;Application&gt;\n                    &lt;Tank&gt;\n                        &lt;Products type=\"list[str]\" scales=\"other/products\"&gt;\n                            Admire\n                        &lt;/Products&gt;\n                        &lt;ApplicationRates scales=\"other/products\"&gt;\n                            &lt;ApplicationRate type=\"float\" unit=\"g/ha\" scales=\"global\"&gt;\n                                380\n                            &lt;/ApplicationRate&gt;\n                        &lt;/ApplicationRates&gt;\n                    &lt;/Tank&gt;\n                    &lt;ApplicationWindow type=\"xCropProtection.MonthDaySpan\" scales=\"global\"&gt;\n                        05-01 to 05-10\n                    &lt;/ApplicationWindow&gt;\n                    &lt;Technology scales=\"global\"&gt;Drift reduction nozzle&lt;/Technology&gt;\n                    &lt;InCropBuffer type=\"float\" unit=\"m\" scales=\"global\"&gt;0&lt;/InCropBuffer&gt;\n                    &lt;InFieldMargin type=\"float\" unit=\"m\" scales=\"global\"&gt;0&lt;/InFieldMargin&gt;\n                &lt;/Application&gt;\n            &lt;/ApplicationSequence&gt;\n            &lt;ApplicationSequence probability=\"0.35\"&gt;\n                &lt;Application&gt;\n                    &lt;Tank&gt;\n                        &lt;Products type=\"list[str]\" scales=\"other/products\"&gt;\n                            Calypso\n                        &lt;/Products&gt;\n                        &lt;ApplicationRates scales=\"other/products\"&gt;\n                            &lt;ApplicationRate type=\"float\" unit=\"g/ha\" scales=\"global\"&gt;\n                                217\n                            &lt;/ApplicationRate&gt;\n                        &lt;/ApplicationRates&gt;\n                    &lt;/Tank&gt;\n                    &lt;ApplicationWindow type=\"xCropProtection.MonthDaySpan\" scales=\"global\"&gt;\n                        05-01 to 05-10\n                    &lt;/ApplicationWindow&gt;\n                    &lt;Technology scales=\"global\"&gt;Drift reduction nozzle&lt;/Technology&gt;\n                    &lt;InCropBuffer type=\"float\" unit=\"m\" scales=\"global\"&gt;0&lt;/InCropBuffer&gt;\n                    &lt;InFieldMargin type=\"float\" unit=\"m\" scales=\"global\"&gt;0&lt;/InFieldMargin&gt;\n                &lt;/Application&gt;\n            &lt;/ApplicationSequence&gt;\n        &lt;/Indication&gt;\n    &lt;/Indications&gt;\n&lt;/PPMCalendar&gt;\n</code></pre>     In this step we have added one <code>Application</code> to each <code>ApplicationSequence</code>.

For example, a scenario might consider how a pesticide behaves in sandy soil under high rainfall conditions. </li> <li>Biotic Factors: These involve living organisms that might be affected by the pesticide, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. The scenario might assess the impact on a specific species or a group of species. </li> <li>Agronomic Practices: This includes farming practices such as land use, crop rotation, land management, irrigation, and pesticide application methods. Different practices can influence how pesticides are distributed and degraded in the environment. </li> <li>Exposure Pathways: Scenarios consider how habitats and species might be exposed to pesticides, such as through forage, water, or contact. </li> <li>Temporal Aspects: The timing of pesticide application, its persistence in the environment and temporal relationship to the occurrence of species are crucial.

However, in environmental risk assessment, scenarios have a regulatory meaning as a testing system, that has to assure a certain protection level in case the test gets passed. In this role, scenarios have to address a certain level of conservatism, hence, need to be representative for a range of conditions of a typically large geographic area (e.g., a country). Whereas detailed scenarios are applied to derive risk estimates, simple ones are used, e.g., for screening a level of conservatism for large areas. Scenarios play a key role in the analysis and definition of effective risk mitigation measures. Scenarios can incorporate buffer zones, the use of drift-reducing technology, reduced application rates, or alternative practices to evaluate risk reduction. Beyond the focus on actual pesticide uses, scenarios serve risk management approaches targeting generic landscape characteristics which affect species populations, communities and biodiversity: e.g., the composition, managment and structure of cultivated landscapes, and their relationship to their surrounding regions. Realistic landscape scenarios can play an important role in policy alignment: The definition of Specific Protection Goals (SPGs, e.g., EFSA 2010, EFSA 2025) is based on the ecosystem services concepts. Modern regulatory developments highlight the important role of landscape scenarios and approaches as a way to contextualize SPGs, e.g., for terrestrial organisms. Future risk and risk assessment will develop beyond single-species laboratory tests and incorporate realistic agricultural landscapes, including spatial and temporal heterogeneity, e.g., to capture both direct and indirect effects of pesticides. Risk management decisions should be informed by how pesticides affect organisms in actual European agroecosystems, not abstract worst-cases or averages. Landscape scenarios can ensure that SPGs align with broader environmental protection mandates to EU biodiversity and sustainability goals.

In this illustrative example, site selection was a 3-step approach:  </p> <ol> <li>At country scale (France), cultivation data consistantly available across France was used to select regions of high apple cropping density. Rationale: Honey bees forage on apple inflorescences. As a managed species, bee keepers like to put their hives in apple cultivation vicinity. Thus, risk of honey bees to get exposed by the use of a PPP in apples is driven by local apple cultivation density, simply: the more apple cultivations the greater the chance of bees to be exposed. Bee activity is driven by weather conditions, eg, temperature, sunshine hours. As e.g., the effect of varying sunshine hours to risk is currently not clear, 3 regions of different climate conditions were selected covering climatic variability to increase scenario represenativeness.</li> <li>At regional level, bee forage mapping was built upon a dataset of Land Use/Cover types covering bee forage offering vegetation (eg, rape, apples, wood and road margins, riparian). The LULC layer was derived using off-the-shelf topographic, cropping, hydrographic datasets, cropping statistics and expert knowledge (eg, wood margin). A vulnerability map was derived combining densities of bee forage with potential exposure (pesticide use in apples).</li> <li>Local identification of realistic bee hive spots was done in cooperation with bee keepers: Beekeepers have the experience on where to place bee hives in a given landscape.

Although this risk assessment design assures a high level of protectiveness, it does not allow to define effective and efficient risk management measures, nor does it provide approaches in cases where unacceptable risk was indicated for worst-case conditions. The need for more realistic risk assessment was also identified in different pesticide risk assessment related workgroups (eg, European Workshop on Probabilistic Risk Assessment for the Environmental Impacts of PPPs (EUPRA, Hart 2001), FOCUS Landscape and Mitigation (FOCUS 2007a, 2007b)), as well as in more generic initiatives (eg, Water Framework Directive (WFD, EC 2000), Sustainable Use Directive (EC 2009b), United Nations 'Millennium Ecosystem Assessment' (2005)). In a phase of improved availability of environmental (geo)data together with the establishment of mechanistic models (eg, EC/Joined Research Centre), early approaches were built for more realistic exposure and risk assessment at landscape-level (eg, Almass, IVA/GeoPERA, Julius-K\u00fchn-Institut/GIS, UBA/GeoRISK). Although significant progress was made, these early approaches had particular deficiencies in how naturally given variability was propagated to outcome (resulting in unrealstic system conditions) and tended to be rather large and intransparent monoliths. The models were not publically available and interoperability was not possible. A stepping stone towards addressing these shortcomings and so, recent developments was provided with the Xplicit approach (Schad &amp; Schulz 2011, Schad 2013). Xplicit intended to reproduce natural pattern of exposure in space and time and to get more modular and open.

External modules (the actual function-providing models) become integrated components using a wrapper.  </li> <li>A core implements the key landscape modelling functionality and semantics (not more). Modules interact with the core.  </li> <li>The composed landscape model appears to the user as any other model, ie it takes inputs (parameterisation, data) and generates outputs.  </li> <li>The implementation process is agile. It is driven by todays' demands (working product) whilst being adaptable in the frame of anticipated developments.  </li> </ol> <p>Landscape Modelling requirements and design principles:</p> <ol> <li>The landscape model works discrete (numeric). Its core dimensions are space and time. It is spatiotemporally explicit. </li> <li>Further modelling dimensions can be introduced by the modelled topics, eg, exposure (of different landscape entities) and effects (and their Specific Protection Goals dimensions, eg, biological entity and attributes).</li> <li>Landscape modelling comes with a strong spatial perception ('maps'). Spatial entities can be represented in any format (eg, raster, vector), scales and shape. Data extent is only limited by computing ressources. The model core, together with corresponding components (modules) inputs external data into inner data stores, which operates semantically-enriched and assures data consistency throughout consuming components. </li> <li>Likewise, the temporal dimension can use the units as needed to represent dynamics of the modelled systems. These can be different in the different components.</li> <li>Data for this multidimensional modelling are held in a multidimensional datastore. The technical representation is independent from the conceptual, ie different data store technologies can be used.</li> <li>The Landscape Model basically implements a Monte Carlo approach. This allows to propagate variabilities (uncertainties) of the natural system (eg, land use, PPP use, weather conditions) to variabilities of the outcome (eg, exposure, effects to organisms). </li> <li>The model works with Semantics to assure mutual 'understanding' of data and models. Semantics are stepwise implemented, starting with physical units, scales and metadata, and are developed up to the use of ontologies. </li> <li>The model is open to introduce new entities, scales and units.</li> <li>The design is based on Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE). The core is considered to work as a microkernel, the components represent the models that bring the actual functionality.</li> </ol> <p>further aspects:</p> <ol> <li>Given its fundamental context, the design of the Landscape Model has at least roots in pesticide risk assessment and risk management (decision support) and related topics like landscape biodiversity enhancements.

Phyton was selected for this. However, components (moduls) can be implemented in basically any language (eg, C, C++, Go, netlogo). The same applies to core functionalities that might have specific needs, eg for speed or parallelisation.  </li> <li>A basic paradigm is scalability. Basically, the spatial and temporal extent of simulations shall not be limited by design, but only by given computing ressources.</li> <li>The development, use and work around a Landscape Model come with differnt roles. Roles have a specific purpose and require different skills, documentation, and traing. Thus, roles need an explicit awareness and definition: eg, 'Core Developer', 'Module Developer', 'Landscape Model Builder', 'Landscape Model User (expert, trained)', 'API Consumer'.</li> <li>During initial development phase, the Landscape Model usability mainly addresses the expert user, ie those who know the purpose, have experiance with modelling on a technical level (eg, understanding the meaning of a certain parameterisation, using xml). Of course, Graphical User Interfaces (eg, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Landscape Model composition) and web-browser-based interaction (eg, for Landscape Model execution and analysis) is important and envisaged.</li> <li>The implementation shall make use of modern versioning and collaboration approaches and systems (eg, Github).</li> <li>The development shall not be done in isolation, but of open minded culture (agile). Whilst trying to get a working product, continued exchange with the communities and research on technologies facilitate adaptivity.</li> <li>The products basically persue an open source culture and paradigm. This applies eg, to the Landscape Model core xlandscape and the majority of components and Landscape Models (eg, xAquatic). However, due to insitutional licence policies some components might be open access, ie are open for use but without the source code of the actual model (eg, Cascade-Toxswa). Of course, the entire Landscape Modelling approach can be used for entirely internal and private developments. This allows hybrid Landscape Models for which some functionality can even get patented.  </li> <li>Last but not least: imagine you are about to develop a specific population model, say an amphibian model, for pesticide RA. Without a modular Landscape Modelling system you'll need to develop anything outside your model yourself, eg, landscape environmental and agricultural scenarios, PPP use, exposure and efate. With such an approach, you can make use of all data and components available, add specific needs (eg, a microclimate model) and focus on your key model development. This is what is called separation of concern.  </li> </ol> <p>Remark: Intense research and trials to work within existing systems (eg, working within GIS systems, close to big-data spatial databases (eg rasdaman), Almass, OpenMI, and a range of related approaches) all ended up in dead ends for the purposes and needs of our work in environmental risk assessment, risk management and the more generic fields (as outlined above).

Eg, the actually continuous (simulation) time is discretised into time steps (of any interval, often [day] or [hour]), spatial entities are discretised using resolutions depending on the individual process (eg, [1m2] for local spray-drift exposure, [100m] segments of stream networks). However, explicitness alone is not a sufficient means to represent natural variability of phenomenons, events and processes, of natural systems, eg, an explicit representation of land use (in space and time) requires that land use is deterministically know for the simulation region and the simulation period (eg use satellite classification). This is often not the case and only general knowledge is available (eg, statistical data and crop cultivation and rotation). Even if full deterministic data is available for a phenomenon (eg, for weather representation by using long-term records) the purpose of a landscape simulation might require to go beyond actual data and consider situations (eg, extremes) which are not part of an actual record. This is a typical situation in regulatory risk assessment where the range of conditions that might happen has to be considered in order for the (prospective) decision making to cover these. This is where the use of distributions comes in. In xLandscape, variability can be represented as Probability Density Functions (PDFs). Examples for using PDFs are wind direction distributions, PPP application windows and application rates, local spray-drift depositions in the (xDrift) component or drift-filtering by riparian vegetation. The scope of validity of a PDF and its elements have to be defined, eg, a weather conditions representing PDF might be valid for a certain geographic regions and a certain time period, it's elements might be valid for a certain day. Thus, samples drawn from this PDF are associated to the scales [region,day]. Irrespective which component asks for weather conditions, the result should be the same for the same region and day, but different for different regions and/or days (corresponding to the random sample of the PDF). This mechanism of scale-dependent definition and use of PDFs enables to build a Monte Carlo approach that generates naturally occuring pattern of the simulated agro-environmental system. In other words, real-world variability comes with pattern, ie, is not just random (an overly simple, independently sampling Monte Carlo approach would just generate chaotic situations).  </p> <p> </p> <p>Propagation of landscape agro-environmental system variability to variability of model predictions</p> <p> </p> <p>Real-world variability has structure, ie, comes with pattern</p>"},{"location":"xLandscape/xLandscape-v1x.html#components-modules-and-models","title":"Components, Modules and Models","text":"<p>You will read the term component quite often in the context of xLandscape. xLandscape is a modular landscape modelling framework that architecture is derived from Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE).

Corresponding multidimentsional data is stored using a multidimensional data store. At present, HDF is being used. All landscape model data as defined by the model designer is stored in an HDF store (basically, the in- and outputs of components). Data in the store can come in independent resolutions (eg, PPP use might be represented by the spatial scale field, whereas local exposure of off-field areas might be calculated and stored by m2 as spatial scale). The same applies to any other dimension and scale. As the multidimensional store contains the data relevant to the specific landscape model, it represents 'the landscape' of the model. Thus, 'the landscape' is built of such data/information that is defined by model design (and configuration). In particular, the store contains the actual model outcome, yet, also any other data is kept as defined by the model designer that might be of interest for the analysis.

The meaning of values exchanged in inputs and outputs of components need to be clearly described.
